                    <span class="qt0">Asthma</span>
                    is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that
                    carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have <span class="qt0">asthma</span>,
                    the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very
                    sensitive, and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or
                    find irritating. When your airways react, they get narrower and your lungs get
                    less air.
                </p>
                <p>Symptoms of <span class="qt0">asthma</span> include
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wheezing</li>
                    <li>Coughing, especially early in the morning or at night</li>
                    <li>Chest tightness</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Not all people who have <span class="qt0">asthma</span> have these symptoms.
                    Having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have <span class="qt0">
                        asthma</span>. Your doctor will diagnose <span class="qt0">asthma</span> based
                    on lung function tests, your medical history, and a physical exam. You may also
                    have allergy tests.
                </p>
                <p>When your <span class="qt0">asthma</span> symptoms become worse than usual, it's
                    called an <span class="qt0">asthma</span> attack. Severe <span class="qt0">
                        asthma
                    </span> attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal.

                <p>In the United States, about 20 million people have <span class="qt0">
                    asthma</span>. Nearly 9 million of them are children. Children have smaller

                    serious for them. Children with <span class="qt0">asthma</span> may experience

                <p>An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother
                    most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than
                    one thing. Substances that often cause reactions are

                    <li>Pollen</li>

                <p>Normally, your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In
                    most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and
                    the environment probably both play a role.
                </p>
                <p>Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing,
                    itching, rashes, swelling, or <span class="qt0">asthma</span>. Allergies can
                    range from minor to severe. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be
                    life-threatening. Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies.
                    Treatments include medicines, allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that
                    cause the reactions.

                <p>You may have heard of anabolic steroids, which can have harmful effects. But

                    treats a variety of problems. These steroids are similar to hormones that your
                    adrenal glands make to fight stress associated with illnesses and injuries. They
                    reduce inflammation and affect the immune system.

            <content name="altTitle">Influenza</content>
            <content name="FullSummary">What is the flu?<p>The flu, also called influenza, is a
                respiratory infection caused by viruses. Each year, millions of Americans get sick
                with the flu. Sometimes it causes mild illness. But it can also be serious or even
                deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain
                chronic illnesses.</p>What causes the flu?<p>The flu is caused by flu viruses that
                spread from person to person. When someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks,
                they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people
                who are nearby. Less often, a person may get flu by touching a surface or object
                that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                eyes.</p>What are the symptoms of the flu?
                <p>Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and may include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fever or feeling feverish/chills</li>
                    <li>Cough</li>
                    <li>Sore throat</li>
                    <li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
                    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
                    <li>Headaches</li>
                    <li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in
                    children.
                </p>
                <p>Sometimes people have trouble figuring out whether they have a cold or the flu.
                    There are differences between them. The symptoms of a cold usually come on more
                    slowly and are less severe than symptoms of the flu. Colds rarely cause a fever
                    or headaches.
                </p>
                <p>Sometimes people say that they have a "flu" when they really have something else.
                    For example, "stomach flu" isn't the flu; it's gastroenteritis.</p>What other
                problems can the flu cause?
                <p>Some people who get the flu will develop complications. Some of these
                    complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bronchitis</li>
                    <li>Ear infection</li>
                    <li>Sinus infection</li>
                    <li>Pneumonia</li>
                    <li>Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle
                        tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with <span class="qt0">
                    asthma
                </span> may have <span class="qt0">asthma</span> attacks while they have flu.
                </p>
                <p>Certain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adults 65 and older</li>
                    <li>Pregnant women</li>
                    <li>Children younger than 5</li>
                    <li>People with certain chronic health conditions, such as <span class="qt0">
                        asthma</span>, diabetes, and heart disease
                    </li>
                </ul>
                How is the flu diagnosed?
                <p>To diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and
                    ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu. For the tests,
                    your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with
                    a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus.
                </p>
                <p>Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not
                    as accurate as other flu tests. These other tests can give you the results in
                    one hour or several hours.</p>What are the treatments for the flu?
                <p>Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with
                    mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to
                    get medical care.
                </p>
                <p>But if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or
                    worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need
                    antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness
                    milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu
                    complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days
                    of getting sick.</p>Can the flu be prevented?
                <p>The best way to prevent the flu is to get flu vaccine every year. But it's also
                    important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your
                    hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu.

                <p>Each spring, summer, and fall, trees, weeds, and grasses release tiny pollen
                    grains into the air. Some of the pollen ends up in your nose and throat. This
                    can trigger a type of allergy called hay fever.
                </p>
                <p>Symptoms can include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sneezing, often with a runny or clogged nose</li>
                    <li>Coughing and postnasal drip</li>
                    <li>Itching eyes, nose and throat</li>
                    <li>Red and watery eyes</li>
                    <li>Dark circles under the eyes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your health care provider may diagnose hay fever based on a physical exam and
                    your symptoms. Sometimes skin or blood tests are used. Taking medicines and
                    using nasal sprays can relieve symptoms. You can also rinse out your nose, but
                    be sure to use distilled or sterilized water with saline. Allergy shots can help
                    make you less sensitive to pollen and provide long-term relief.

                <p>Ozone is a gas. It can be good or bad, depending on where it is. "Good" ozone
                    occurs naturally about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth's surface. It shields us
                    from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Part of the good ozone layer is gone. Man-made
                    chemicals have destroyed it. Without enough good ozone, people may get too much
                    ultraviolet radiation. This may increase the risk of skin cancer, cataracts, and

            <content name="FullSummary">What are the health effects of smoking?
                <p>There's no way around it; smoking is bad for your health. It harms nearly every
                    organ of the body, some that you would not expect. Cigarette smoking causes
                    nearly one in five deaths in the United States. It can also cause many other
                    cancers and health problems. These include
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cancers, including lung and oral cancers</li>
                    <li>Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)</li>
                    <li>Damage to and thickening of blood vessels, which causes high blood
                        pressure
                    </li>
                    <li>Blood clots and stroke</li>
                    <li>Vision problems, such as cataracts and macular degeneration (AMD)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Women who smoke while pregnant have a greater chance of certain pregnancy
                    problems. Their babies are also at higher risk of dying of sudden infant death
                    syndrome (SIDS).
                </p>
                <p>Smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug that is in tobacco.
                    Nicotine addiction makes it much harder for people to quit smoking.</p>What are
                the health risks of secondhand smoke?
                <p>Your smoke is also bad for other people - they breathe in your smoke secondhand
                    and can get many of the same problems as smokers do. This includes heart disease
                    and lung cancer. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of ear
                    infections, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe <span class="qt0">
                        asthma</span>. Mothers who breathe secondhand smoke while pregnant are more
                    likely to have preterm labor and babies with low birth weight.
                </p>
                Are other forms of tobacco also dangerous?
                <p>Besides cigarettes, there are several other forms of tobacco. Some people smoke
                    tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain
                    harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire
                    pack of cigarettes.
                </p>
                <p>E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are
                    battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Not
                    much is known about the health risks of using them. We do know they contain
                    nicotine, the same addictive substance in tobacco cigarettes. E-cigarettes also
                    expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which
                    contain harmful chemicals.
                </p>
                <p>Smokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your
                    health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It
                    also increases your risk of getting heart disease, gum disease, and oral
                    lesions.</p>Why should I quit?
                <p>Remember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette
                    per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death.
                    Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems. The earlier you quit,
                    the greater the benefit. Some immediate benefits of quitting include
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower heart rate and blood pressure</li>
                    <li>Less carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's
                        ability to carry oxygen)
                    </li>
                    <li>Better circulation</li>
                    <li>Less coughing and wheezing</li>
                </ul>
